Python Snake Game
Overview

This Python Snake Game is a simple yet engaging project developed as part of the Udemy course "100 Days of Code." The game is designed to replicate the classic snake game where the player controls a snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding obstacles and the edges of the game area. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, increasing the game's difficulty.
Features

    Classic Gameplay: Navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself or the game boundaries.
    Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each piece of food the snake eats.
    Simple Controls: Use the keyboard arrows to control the snake's direction.
    Game Over Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.

Technologies Used

    Python 3
    Turtle Graphics for the game's GUI

Installation

To run this game, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from python.org.

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd snake-game

Run the game:

    python3 main.py

What I Learned

  
    Object-Oriented Programming: I learned how to use classes and objects in Python, which was crucial for organizing the game's code and managing the snake, food, and game states.
    Using Libraries: This project enhanced my understanding of Python libraries, such as Turtle for drawing the game's GUI, which taught me how to read and understand external code documentation.
    Game Logic Development: I gained experience in developing game logic, such as detecting collisions and controlling the snake's movement, which improved my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.
    Project Structure: Completing this project strengthened my skills on how to structure a programming project, manage files, and organize code for readability and maintainability.

Future Improvements

    Add levels of difficulty
    Introduce more obstacles
    Implement a leaderboard to track high scores
